  The following is a YouTube transcript from a video titled "{video_title}".
  
  *** Your Task ***
  Act as a language expert fluent in both {target_language} and English.
  Analyze the provided transcript of a language lesson where a teacher and student are studying {target_language}.
  
  1. Extract Examples:
     - Identify new words introduced by the teacher
     - Find sentences the student is asked to translate from English to {target_language}
     - Find the correct translation for each word and sentence within the transcript
  
  2. Error Correction:
     - As this is an automatically generated transcript, there may be spelling errors
     - Try to stick as close as possible to the transcript, only correct very obvious and glaring spelling errors
     - If you can not determine what was said for a specific example, you can skip it and move on to the next example
  
  *** Output Format ***
  Present the extracted examples in a CSV format as follows:
  
  English; {target_language}
  [English word/phrase]; [{target_language} translation]
  
  Notes:
  - Include one whitespace after each semicolon
  - List single words first, followed by phrases and sentences
  
  Example (for a hypothetical Swahili lesson):
  English; Swahili
  to sleep; kulala
  to eat; kula
  to want; kutaka
  Sleep well; Lala salama
  I want to go out; Nataka kutoka
  Where do you want to go?; Unataka kwenda wapi?
  Where are you traveling now?; Unasafiri wapi sasa?
